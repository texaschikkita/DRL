        "## **üîç Key Observations**\n",
        "1. **Feature-wise MAE & RMSE have not consistently improved.**\n",
        "   - The **expected** outcome was a **reduction in error** due to the augmentation.\n",
        "   - However, for some features (e.g., **Feature 6, 8-11**), **errors increased** slightly.\n",
        "   - **This suggests that data augmentation introduced noise** that the model couldn‚Äôt fully learn from.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **R¬≤ Scores are Worse for Some Features**\n",
        "   - Some features, like **Feature 6 and Feature 8-11**, have **slightly negative R¬≤ values** (bad).\n",
        "   - Negative **R¬≤ means the model is performing worse than just predicting the mean**.\n",
        "   - **This is unexpected**‚Äîaugmentation was supposed to **improve generalization**.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **üîé Why Didn‚Äôt Data Augmentation Improve Performance?**\n",
        "1. **Molecular Data is Highly Structured**  \n",
        "   - Unlike images where small perturbations are okay, **molecular graphs have strict physical constraints**.  \n",
        "   - Adding random noise to node features **might break real-world chemical relationships**.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Augmentation Changed Feature Distributions**  \n",
        "   - The model was **trained on normalized data**, but **augmented data shifted the feature distribution**.  \n",
        "   - **Result:** The model struggled to generalize to the new distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Graph Attention Networks (GAT) Are Sensitive to Noise**  \n",
        "   - GAT **focuses on weighted edges**, so introducing **random noise at the node level** can **disrupt attention mechanisms**.  \n",
        "   - This may explain why **Feature 6 and Feature 8-11 degraded**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Molecular Properties are Dependent on Structural Integrity**  \n",
        "   - In NLP or CV, **data augmentation is common**, but in **molecular graphs, perturbations can alter fundamental chemical properties**.  \n",
